/**
 * Keeps `--app-h` equal to the height that is actually visible on screen.
 *
 * The rule this file exists to enforce: **`100dvh` is authoritative, and JS only
 * intervenes when the engine is measurably wrong.**
 *
 * That is a correction of the first version (2026-09-08), which unconditionally wrote
 * `window.innerHeight` into `--app-h` on every viewport event. It made the gap it was
 * meant to fix *more* likely, and here is why: `100dvh` is recomputed continuously by
 * the browser, so it is correct by construction at every instant. A pixel snapshot is
 * correct only until the next change. Writing one as an inline style on `<html>`
 * permanently replaces the self-maintaining value with a static one — so when iOS fired
 * `resize` repeatedly *through* its toolbar animation and the last event carried an
 * intermediate height, that intermediate value was latched forever, and `dvh` could no
 * longer rescue it. The blank strip came back (Jack, 2026-09-09).
 *
 * So: sample only once the viewport has stopped moving, hand the value back to `dvh`
 * first, and re-apply an override only if `dvh` still disagrees with the real visible
 * height. In the normal case nothing is overridden at all.
 *
 * The `removeProperty` is doing two jobs — it restores `dvh`, and the style mutation is
 * itself the relayout iOS otherwise skips, which was the original diagnosis and still
 * holds for the desktop desk. The phone view no longer depends on any of this: it was
 * restructured on 2026-09-09 to scroll the document natively rather than sit in a fixed
 * viewport-sized shell, which makes the bug structurally impossible there. This file is
 * now the safety net for the desktop shell, not the mobile fix.
 *
 * `window.innerHeight` remains the reference rather than `visualViewport.height`: the
 * two agree as the toolbars animate, but only the latter also shrinks under pinch-zoom,
 * which would collapse the shell to the zoom window. Zoomed viewports are skipped.
